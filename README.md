# Docs Decomposer

Inventory a corpus of documentation by breaking each page down into
its:

- Heading structure (h-tags)
- Code and command line examples/steps (pre/code elements)
- Procedures (ordered, unordered lists)
- Screenshots (images)

Offer a tool to rate procedures and examples in terms of maintenance
risk.

Provide a way for multiple users to conduct reviews.

Create unique hashes for all elements (examples, procedures,
screenshots) in order to check for recurrence of elements across
versions of the documentation and offer the opportunity to examine
un-updated content for risk.
